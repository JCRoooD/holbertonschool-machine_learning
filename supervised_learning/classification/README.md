# Classification Using Neural Networks

## Description
This project focuses on building and training neural network models for classification tasks using Python. The project includes a series of tasks that gradually build up the knowledge and implementation of neural network components and functions from scratch.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the aid of external resources:

- **General Concepts:**
  - What is a model?
  - What is supervised learning?
  - What is a prediction, a node, a weight, and a bias?
  - Activation functions: Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, Softmax
  - What is a layer? What are hidden layers?
  - What is Logistic Regression?
  - Understanding of loss and cost functions
  - Forward propagation and Gradient Descent
  - Back propagation and Computation Graphs
  - How to initialize weights and biases
  - The importance of vectorization
  - Data splitting methods
  - Multiclass classification and one-hot vectors
  - What is cross-entropy loss?
  - Pickling in Python for object serialization

## Project Tasks
- **0. Neuron Class**: Implementation of a single neuron performing binary classification.
- **1. Privatize Neuron**: Making attributes private and adding getter methods.
- **2. Neuron Forward Propagation**: Implement forward propagation for a single neuron.
- **3 to 7**: Building upon the Neuron class by adding cost calculation, evaluation methods, and training procedures including Gradient Descent.
- **8 to 15**: Extending to a neural network with one hidden layer including forward propagation, cost evaluation, and training capabilities.
- **16 onwards**: Introducing a Deep Neural Network class with multiple layers, implementing forward propagation, cost functions, evaluations, and training with the ability to save and load models.
